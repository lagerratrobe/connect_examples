1. Create the site and make sure that it builds locally
2. Run `rsconnect::writeManifest(contentCategory = "site")` to create a manifest.json that has the right content_category type, ("content_category": "site",)
3. Commit and push the site to Github
4. Login to Connect --> Publish --> Import from Git (use HTTPS git repo URL)

The Bookdown site should now be visble in Connect and will be checked for updates on Github every 15 min.  Everytime a change is pulled in from Github, the site will rebuild.
