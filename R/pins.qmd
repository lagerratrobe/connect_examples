# Pins {.unnumbered}

The easiest way to publish a Pins board is to use the RStudio IDE to create an R file that contains the information needed to transmit data and "pin" it to the Connect server.

**Note:** The information below is taken from [here](https://docs.rstudio.com/how-to-guides/users/pro-tips/pins/) and adapted for the purpose of this guide.

## Prerequisites

-   Pins package

## Verify Connect server is registered

Select the dropdown next to the **Publish Application** button and choose **Manage Accounts**.

This will bring up a window that shows what Connect servers you are registered to publish to.

If the **Publishing Accounts** area is blank, follow the instructions in [Connecting Your Account](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/connecting/) to register your Connect server to your IDE.

## Create Content {.numbered}

### 1. Create a new R script named `faithful_pin.R`

### 2. Drop the following code into the file

```
# Establish connection to Connect server
board <- pins::board_rsconnect()

# Create small data set
my_data <- faithful #for example

# Write data to server
pins::pin_write(board,
                my_data,
                name = "faithful_data")
```

## Publish Content {.numbered}

### 1. Run the script

Click on __Source__ in the IDE

__Source__ will execute the contents of the current file and you should see the following in the Console window"

```

Guessing `type = 'rds'`
Writing to pin 'roger.andre/faithful_data'
```

### 2. Verify the content on Connect

You should see the newly published pin set in your Content listing.

Click on the content and you should see information about the data listed.
