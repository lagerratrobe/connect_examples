Background:
-----------

While there are many documented examples of how to publish different content types to Connect, many are complex and more focused on the framework than on the act of publication itself.  While useful in specific situations, there is evidence that a complete set of simpler, more focused examples, are needed as well.

Anticipated Outcome:
--------------------

The intent of this project is to create a set of small examples that a System Administrator or IT professional could use to validate that their Connect system works as expected.  This example set would contain the full range of formats that Connect supports as of release 2022.09.01 and be documented in such a way that new formats can ve easily added to it.  We believe that a Quarto doc  is best suited for this, as it can then be used in part, or in its entirety, as a source for other official documentation.

In addition to generating a useful, consolidated source of information for all to use, this project will also serve as a springboard for Roger to learn some fundamental concepts, such as:

* Quarto
* Bokeh, Dash, FastAPI and Pins
* knowledge and experience with the full range of deployment tools, including; rsconnect, rsconnect-python and connectapi libraries
* a better understanding of our existing documentation and "where to look" for answers

RACI:
-----

* Responsible - Roger
* Accountable - Devin
* Consulted - Kelly, Katie, David
* Informed - Solutions Engineering, Connect-related PM

Key Activities:
---------------

- [X] Catalog all currently supported content types and minimum version of Connect needed to support them
- [ ] Feedback from key stakeholders
- [ ] Validation of existing and new examples to ensure that they meet the needs of the intended user and work as expected
- [ ] Documentation of deployment steps for each content type.  Supported with images and/or code as appropriate
