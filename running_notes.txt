In order to use these examples, your Connect server license must match the following.

Connect Base: suppoorts Shiny, RMarkdown, Quarto and Jupyter Lab/Notebooks
Connect Standard: adds support for "APIs and Interactive Python Products" (What exactly does this mean. ie "Pins", "Quarto", etc.)

2. Connect Server API keys
You will need to have a Connect API key available and you will need to have the following environment variables set appropriately

CONNECT_SERVER = <connect_server_ip>
CONNECT_API_KEY = <connect_api_key>
This can be verified by using the R Sys.getenv() function.

> Sys.getenv("CONNECT_SERVER")
> Sys.getenv("CONNECT_API_KEY")

Publish a Plumber API
app code in R/plumber
publish with R/publish_plumber_api.R
Once published, if the vanity URL is changed to "plumber" then the following request:

http://3.144.138.21/plumber/cars?cyl=4
Should return:

[
    {
        "cyl": 4,
        "mpg": 22.8,
        "model": "Datsun 710"
    },
    {
        "cyl": 4,
        "mpg": 24.4,
        "model": "Merc 240D"
    },
    {
        "cyl": 4,
        "mpg": 22.8,
        "model": "Merc 230"
    },
    {
        "cyl": 4,
        "mpg": 32.4,
        "model": "Fiat 128"
    },
